#  Kawaii Todo List (HTML & CSS Only)

This is a simple and cute to-do list I created using only HTML and CSS. It’s based on a Figma design and was part of a learning task to practice front-end layout and styling. The goal was to focus on design — no JavaScript or functionality yet, just making it look like the Figma.

## Project Goal

. Build a to-do list UI using only HTML and CSS
. Recreate the layout and styling from a Figma design
. Make it responsive for mobile screens
. Use soft colors, rounded shapes, and kawaii style

## ✨ What I Used

- Google Font: *Carter One* for a playful, bold look
- Pink and soft red colors to match the kawaii theme
- Rounded input and button styles
- Unicode icons for ✎ (edit) and ✖ (delete)
- A bunny image at the bottom for decoration
- Flexbox to center items and media queries for responsiveness

## 🧠 What I Learned

. How to structure a clean HTML file
. How to apply external CSS and Google Fonts
. Using Flexbox to align and space elements
. How to make the layout responsive for phones
. Adding special characters using Unicode

## Challenges I Faced

.Many problems happened with image paths — I learned that absolute paths don’t work in web projects, and I should use relative ones like `assets/bunny.jpg`
. It took time to understand how to create folders properly and place files in the right structure
. My background image wasn’t showing because I used the wrong syntax
. Aligning the edit and delete icons inside the task list wasn’t easy
. Getting the design to look like the Figma version took many tries and adjustments
. Mobile responsiveness was confusing at first, especially padding and font sizes
. At one point, the entire layout was broken due to height units missing (`px`)
. I struggled a bit with Google Fonts at first and understanding when to use `font-family` correctly
. I also had to debug opacity issues and learned that `opacity: 50%` is wrong — it should be `0.5`
. Keeping the edit and delete icons aligned nicely inside the task list
. Deciding how much spacing to use without breaking mobile layout

## ✅ Notes

. This is only the UI part — no real functionality yet.
. Later I can add JavaScript to make the tasks actually work (add, edit, delete).
. I really enjoyed styling the design and learned a lot through trial and error.
